Why should I use it?
--------------------

No one likes a messy code base. When working on a team, it becomes more and more difficult to make sure that your project's code stays consistent and error free. Since the hook can lint all of the project's code, based on your configuration, you can be sure that at the very least standards are being followed. It can also run build steps, unit tests, or any other script you like.

Having a tool that automates this process has been priceless for us, and has very much improved the quality of our code.
